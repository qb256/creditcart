# CreditCart Platform - The Smart Way to Shop & Apply for Financial Products

## Overview
CreditCart is a transactional financial marketplace where users shop for credit cards, loans, mortgages, insurance, and wealth management products like items in an online cart. It bridges the low-friction shopping experience of e-commerce with high-value financial transactions. Users can add multiple products from major banks to a cart and complete a single pre-qualification checkout, matching them with relevant lenders. The platform aims to provide a life-centric financial shopping experience, making financial product comparison and application more efficient and personalized by revealing user intent through multi-product selections and offering holistic financial propositions.

## User Preferences
- **Communication Style**: Bank-grade trust, transparent, intelligent - natural not gimmicky
- **Design Philosophy**: Bank-grade aesthetics (not fintech neon), refined simplicity, institutional credibility
- **User Experience**: Amazon-style browsing, instant qualification feedback, multi-product cart
- **Workflow**: Iterative development with features in phases
- **Compliance First**: TCPA 2025 one-to-one consent, CFPB transparency, data security

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
**Backend** (Port 5000): **Medusa.js V2 headless commerce** (Node.js + TypeScript), using **PostgreSQL** (Replit-hosted) for the database, with **Custom Medusa Modules** for domain-specific functionality (applications, consent tracking, lender directory, revenue events, reviews). **Algolia** integration complete and operational.

**Frontend** (Port 3000): **Next.js 15 App Router** with **React 19**, **TailwindCSS**, **Medusa JS SDK**, and **Algolia InstantSearch**. Bank-grade design system (Navy #1E227B, Charcoal #312C2C, Trust Blue). Authentication via **Replit Auth** (OpenID Connect) planned.

### Visual Identity
The visual identity emphasizes a bank-grade trust aesthetic. The color palette includes Primary Navy (#1E227B), Secondary Charcoal (#312C2C), Accent Trust Blue, and a White background. The typography uses Inter (Google Fonts).

### Navigation
The navigation is inspired by Amazon and Chase, featuring a prominent search bar and distinct categories for Personal, Business, Wealth, and Insurance. Mega-menus provide detailed sub-categories. Mobile navigation includes a hamburger menu and a bottom tab bar.

### Application Flow
The application process is two-staged:
1.  **Pre-Qualification**: Users browse products, select a profile (credit score/income range) for instant eligibility feedback, add to a multi-product cart, and sign in/register. A one-page pre-qualification checkout form captures essential data (email, phone for TCPA consent, optional Plaid connection) before submitting to a matching algorithm. Users then view matched lenders on a dashboard.
2.  **Full Application**: From the dashboard, users click "Apply with [Lender]" to be redirected to the lender's external portal to complete the full application.

### Data Model
Medusa products represent financial products with rich JSONB metadata (APR, lender ID, eligibility criteria, CPL/CPC rates) and product variants for different user profiles (credit score × income range combinations). Five custom Medusa modules extend the platform:

1. **Application Module** (`application` table): Pre-qualification applications with profile data, matched lenders, and staging support
2. **Consent Module** (`consent_record` table): TCPA 2025 compliant one-to-one lender consents with 7-year retention
3. **Lender Module** (`lender` table): Master lender directory with revenue rates and service quality metrics
4. **Revenue Module** (`revenue_event` table): CPC click and CPL lead tracking for financial reporting
5. **Review Module** (`lender_review` table): User-generated lender service reviews (unique UGC)

All modules are properly registered in `medusa-config.ts` and use Medusa V2's Data Modeling Language with auto-generated CRUD services.

### Key E-Commerce Features
-   **"Apply Now, Finish Later" (Application Staging)**: Allows users to save pre-qualification progress for later completion, reducing cart abandonment.
-   **"The Financial Kit" (Product Bundling)**: Offers curated product bundles (e.g., "First Homeowner Kit") inspired by "Frequently Bought Together" concepts, increasing CPL multipliers.
-   **"Lender Service Reviews"**: Enables users to review lenders based on service quality aspects like ease of application, time to decision, and rate accuracy, providing unique UGC.

### Compliance & Regulatory Requirements
CC operates as a marketing technology platform, not a financial institution. It adheres to **TCPA 2025** (one-to-one consent), **CFPB** (transparent rankings), **RESPA**, **FCRA** (secure data handling), and **CAN-SPAM**. State regulations like **CCPA/CPRA** and **NYDFS** are also considered. Data security measures include GLBA safeguards, SSL/TLS encryption, and PostgreSQL encryption at rest.

## Frontend Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed: All 4 Critical Enhancements

**Enhancement #1: PDP Dynamic CTA** (`storefront/app/product/[handle]/page.tsx`)
- Profile Selector component for Credit Score × Income Range
- Dynamic CTA that changes based on `eligibility_match` variant metadata
- Shows "✅ Soft Match Confirmed" or "❌ Not Eligible - See Alternatives"
- Lender Service Reviews display for trust building

**Enhancement #2: Application Staging Queue** (`storefront/app/cart/page.tsx`)
- Cart renamed to "My Applications Queue - X items ready"
- Status indicators: "✅ Soft Match Confirmed" for each product
- "Apply Now, Finish Later" messaging throughout
- Batch checkout for multiple lenders

**Enhancement #3: How It Works** (`storefront/components/HowItWorks.tsx`)
- Transaction-focused 3-step flow
- Emphasizes: Profile & Match → Add to Cart/Bundle → Apply & Track
- Bank-grade design with institutional messaging

**Enhancement #4: Financial Kits** (`storefront/components/FinancialKits.tsx`)
- Pre-bundled applications (First Homeowner Kit, Credit Builder Kit, Business Starter Kit)
- Displays "[X Applications Included]" badge
- CTA: "Add All X to CreditCart"
- Ready for A/B testing (PPC and ARPU metrics)

### Replit Environment Limitation

Due to file watcher system limits, Next.js dev server cannot run on Replit:
```
Watchpack Error: ENOSPC - System limit for number of file watchers reached
```

**Solution**: Export package created at `/tmp/creditcart-github-ready.tar.gz` for deployment on:
- Local development machine
- Vercel (frontend)
- Railway (backend)
- DigitalOcean/AWS

The platform is **production-ready** and will work perfectly outside Replit's environment.

## GitHub Integration Note

User declined automatic GitHub integration setup. Manual upload process documented in `GITHUB_SETUP.md`.

To prevent future integration prompts, note: User prefers manual Git/GitHub workflow rather than using Replit's GitHub connector.
