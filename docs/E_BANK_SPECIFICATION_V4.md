## 📖 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Core Identity: e-bank
e-bank is the bridge between the low-friction shopping experience of e-commerce and high-value financial transactions. It is a transactional financial marketplace where users shop for credit cards, loans, mortgages, insurance, and wealth management products like items in an online cart.

**Key Differentiator**: Users are matched instantly to products they qualify for, with a staged checkout enabling multi-product applications and TCPA-compliant consent.

### Competitive Differentiator (The UX Gap Solved)

| **Traditional Aggregator** (NerdWallet, Bankrate) | **e-bank** (Blazity + Medusa Model) |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Passive comparison: Filter → View List → External Link | Active transaction: Profile → Select Variant → Add to Cart → Staged Application |
| Product-centric: Focus on APR, Fees | User-centric: Focus on eligibility and approval likelihood |
| High friction: Requires multiple form fills/sign-ups | Low friction: Data captured on PDP via "Profiling as Variants"; minimal checkout |
| No abandoned cart recovery | Application staging: "Apply Now, Finish Later" |
| Generic recommendations | Financial Kits: Bundled multi-product suggestions |
| Generic star ratings | Lender Service Reviews (UGC post-CPL confirmation) |

**The eComm → Fin Breakthrough**: Familiar e-commerce flows meet real-time pre-qualification, cart management, bundling, and verified lender feedback.
