# e-bank Product Seeding Summary

## ✅ What's Been Built (ARCHITECT-REVIEWED ✓)

### Critical Fixes Applied
- ✅ **Lender ID Resolution**: Automatically resolves lender keys ("chase", "amex") to actual database UUIDs
- ✅ **Required Fields**: All FinancialProductMetadata required fields now populated with sensible defaults
- ✅ **Field Name Normalization**: Fixed `signup_bonus` → `sign_up_bonus` for type compliance
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Throws early if lender not found, preventing orphaned products
