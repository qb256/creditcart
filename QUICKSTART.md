# CreditCart Platform - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What's Already Running

Your **Medusa.js V2 backend** is operational:
- ✅ Running on port 5000
- ✅ 10 major lenders seeded (Chase, Amex, Capital One, Citi, Discover, Wells Fargo, BofA, U.S. Bank, Barclays, Synchrony)
- ✅ 40 financial products with profile-based variants
- ✅ Algolia neural search (all 40 products indexed)
- ✅ Custom modules loaded (Lender, Application, Consent, Revenue, Review)
- ✅ CORS configured for storefront (localhost:3000)

## 🚀 Start the CreditCart Storefront (One Command!)

Open the Replit Shell and run:

```bash
cd storefront && npm install && npm run dev
```

That's it! The storefront will be available at **http://localhost:3000**

## 🎯 All 4 Critical Enhancements Are Built

### 1. PDP with Dynamic CTA (Enhancement #1)
**Location**: `storefront/app/product/[handle]/page.tsx`

**What it does**:
- User selects Credit Score + Income Range
- System matches to product variant with `eligibility_match` metadata
- CTA changes dynamically:
  - ✅ Match: "Add to CreditCart"
  - ❌ No Match: "Not Eligible - See Alternatives"
- Shows Lender Service Score for trust

**Test it**:
1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. Click any product
3. Change credit score/income selectors
4. Watch the CTA update in real-time

   curl http://localhost:5000/health
   ```

2. **View Products API**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/store/products | jq
   ```

3. **Check Algolia Index**:
   - All 40 products are indexed
   - Neural search ready for InstantSearch UI

4. **Frontend Testing**:
   - Homepage: http://localhost:3000
   - Any Product: http://localhost:3000/product/chase-sapphire-reserve
   - Application Queue: http://localhost:3000/cart

## 🚀 Next Steps

After verifying all 4 enhancements work:

1. **Connect Real Medusa Cart API** (currently using mock data in Application Queue)
2. **Integrate Algolia InstantSearch** on product listing page
3. **Add Replit Auth** for user sign-in
4. **Build Pre-Qualification Checkout Form** (TCPA consent capture)
5. **Implement Dashboard** for tracking application status

## 💡 Revenue Model Reminder

- **CPC** (Cost Per Click): $5-$18 per click to lender portal
- **CPL** (Cost Per Lead): $50-$175 per qualified application
- **Average**: $11.83 CPC, $108.27 CPL across product categories

## 🎯 Success Metrics to Track

- **Products Per Cart (PPC)**: Avg items in Application Queue
- **A/B Test**: Financial Kits vs. Standard Browse (measure PPC impact)
- **ARPU** (Average Revenue Per User): Track CPC + CPL per session
- **Conversion Rate**: Soft Match → Full Application
